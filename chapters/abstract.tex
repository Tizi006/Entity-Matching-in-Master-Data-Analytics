Entity Matching (EM) is a key task in today’s cloud-based data ecosystems, where data from 
many heterogeneous sources must be reliably integrated. Recent EM approaches rely on 
powerful black-box models, which achieve high accuracy but offer little transparency. 
Existing explainability techniques are rarely applied to EM and face specific challenges: they 
must cope with heterogeneous representations of entities, large volumes of data, and 
explanations that often fail to capture the unique semantic characteristics of EM decisions. In 
this project, we investigate explainable EM by applying black-box explainers such as SHAP, 
LIME, and related methods to current EM models to one fixed model. 

Concretely, we run a set of benchmark EM datasets through a black-box model, generate 
local explanations for its duplicate and non-duplicate predictions, and compare these 
explanation methods with respect to fidelity, stability, and usability. We will further visualize 
the explanations to make the decision process of the EM model accessible to human users. 
The overall objective is to implement and evaluate interpretable methods that clearly explain 
why two records are classified as duplicates or not, thereby increasing trust in EM systems 
and supporting users in debugging, validating, and improving data integration pipelines.
