\section{LEMON\cite{lemon} (Explainable Entity Matching)}

LEMON aims to make individual predictions of an entity matcher explainable. Formally, a matcher
$f(x)$ returns a score in $[0,1]$ for an input pair $x=(a,b)$. A \emph{local, post-hoc attribution
explanation} is then a procedure $\lambda(f,x)$ that links parts of the input $x$ to relevance
values (attributions) and communicates them in a way that is interpretable for humans.

\subsubsection{LIME\cite{lime} as a baseline: Local surrogate models through perturbations}
LEMON is fundamentally based on LIME. The key idea of LIME is to approximate local decision rules
in order to explain a specific instance using an easily interpretable surrogate model. To do so,
the instance is first broken down into tokens, on which random perturbations are generated. The
generated data is evaluated by the black-box model, and the resulting samples are used to train a
regression model. The regression coefficients then indicate which tokens locally change the match
score.

\subsubsection{LEMON: Addressing weaknesses of LIME}
LEMON addresses three weaknesses of LIME:

\paragraph{Cross-record interaction effects.}
Linear regression implicitly assumes feature independence, which is often violated due to strong
interactions between fields. LEMON therefore treats both data points individually, yielding
\emph{dual explanations}: while one record is perturbed, the other remains constant.

\paragraph{Non-match explanations.}
For very low match scores, removing features often causes only barely measurable score changes,
so little explanatory information is learned. LEMON replaces binary on/off perturbations with a
three-state scheme:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Present (P)} and \textbf{Absent (A)} correspond to the binary system.
  \item \textbf{Matched (M)}: the token is copied and additionally injected into the other record.
\end{itemize}
Tokens are inserted at several randomly sampled positions; among these, the position with the
highest overall prediction score is selected.

\paragraph{Variation in sensitivity.}
Depending on the pair and dataset, noticeable score changes may require perturbing many coarse
parts, whereas explanations should ideally rely on few features. LEMON therefore selects the
feature granularity adaptively using its own metric: the number of tokens combined into a feature
is doubled iteratively until a maximum is reached or the metric permits selection.

When tokens are combined into a feature, each associated token assumes the same state. The key
metric is the \emph{counterfactual criterion}: an explanation should not only provide local
weights, but also make plausible which minimal changes would move the score above (or below) the
classification threshold. If no granularity meets the criterion, the ``best'' granularity is
selected via a harmonic-mean criterion. This selection is performed separately for both dual
explanations.

\subsubsection{Feature search, attributions, and attribution potential}
A forward selection procedure is used to choose the features to analyze; selected features must
maximize the surrogate model prediction score. For each feature, the surrogate forms a baseline
using features set to state $P$. Each feature receives two weights, computed from states $A$ and
$M$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{negated} weight obtained via $A$ defines the \textbf{attribution}, indicating
  how much the feature contributed to the prediction of the black-box model.
  \item The weight obtained via $M$ defines the \textbf{attribution potential}, i.e., the change
  in prediction caused by inserting that feature into the other record.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Method}
Nine different data pairs were analyzed. Due to high computational costs, feature granularity was
fixed at the attribute level. An additional training pair was evaluated using an increased sample
size and adaptive granularity.

\subsubsection{Results}
If the input is formatted incorrectly such that contents of data points 1 and 2 are mixed, the
model consistently returns a negative prediction because it effectively no longer processes a
consistent comparison pair. Such a pipeline error is easily identified with LEMON: if weights and
potentials remain close to $0$ across all attributes, perturbations of the model input have
virtually no influence on the output. This indicates that the decision is not data-driven but
dominated by a structural input error.

Negative values shift the decision towards \emph{non-match}, whereas positive values support
\emph{match}.

\paragraph{Model behaviour and score characteristics.}
Model outputs are highly saturated and form two clusters: non-match scores of approximately
$7\cdot 10^{-6}$ to $8.5\cdot 10^{-6}$, and match scores around $0.99998$. This extreme confidence
suggests that in the saturated regime, small input changes only slightly affect the score.
Accordingly, removal-based attributions can be insensitive in some cases. Here, \emph{attribution
potential} provides clear additional value as a counterfactual signal, because it is more
sensitive.

Across match cases, \texttt{authors} and \texttt{title} consistently dominate as the strongest
positive contributors, while \texttt{year} sometimes contributes significantly but is less stable.
The decisiveness of \texttt{authors} and \texttt{title} is also visible in non-match examples via
high attribution potential. In contrast, \texttt{venue} typically contributes little and can even
be slightly negative. Overall, this corresponds to a matcher where author/title proximity are the
main anchors, year acts as a case-dependent constraint, and venue is secondary or prone to noise.

\paragraph{Interpretability and limitations.}
LEMON yields useful but partially limited explanations of the model decisions. A key strength is
the stable and consistent weighting logic across cases: the same attribute groups repeatedly
appear as dominant drivers, and weight signs are largely plausible in non-match cases. This
produces a comprehensible reasoning trail and reduces the black-box character of the decision to
a few central fields.

The most important added value in these results is the attribution potential. Especially for
extremely saturated probabilities close to $0$, pure removal attributions often lack sensitivity.
The potential compensates for this: in several non-match examples it is very high for specific
fields (in some cases close to $1.0$), enabling a counterfactual interpretation. LEMON thus
supports not only reasoning but also concrete error diagnosis in the sense of: which information
is missing or inconsistent such that the model does not match?

A practical limitation is computational cost. In this configuration, explanations are only
moderately granular and use a limited number of samples, because LEMON requires substantial VRAM.
In a complex example with $\texttt{granularity}=\texttt{"counterfactual"}$, the sample size was
set heuristically and required allocating $16.88$~GB of VRAM.
